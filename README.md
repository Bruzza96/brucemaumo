# 👋 Hi there, I'm Bruce Maumo  

🌱 I’m currently enrolled in the **Software Engineering Programme at ALX Africa**, where I’m learning the foundations of coding, problem-solving, and building real-world projects.  

💻 As a beginner in tech, I’m focused on:
- Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React – in progress 🚀)
- Backend basics (Python, Databases – soon to explore)

✨ **What I bring to the table:**
- Curiosity & a growth mindset 🌍  
- Strong skills in **organization, time management, and self-learning**  
- Experience in **customer support & communication**, which helps me collaborate effectively  

📌 **My Goals:**  
- Build a strong foundation in full-stack development  
- Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers  
- Document my learning journey and share projects here on GitHub
